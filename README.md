# Our Goal
Study Better is an app that aims to create informative and useful quizzes and flashcards from user input such as topics, courses, and topics.\n
It is initially being build for the Schoolhouse.world CS Hackathon.

## Setup
### Backend
1. Go into backend folder
2. Run 'source venv/bin/activate'
3. Run 'python3 app.py' to start the backend server(do this if you are doing front end as well, because this gives input to frontend)

### Frontend
1. Go into frontend folder
2. Run 'npm start' to ensure it works, it should give some physics questions for now (this is the DEVELOPMENT server, so use this when writing code).
3. Run 'npm run build' to make the PRODUCTION server, this is the final product kind of.

**Make sure you have multiple terminals open so you can have the TWO servers running at the same time**
